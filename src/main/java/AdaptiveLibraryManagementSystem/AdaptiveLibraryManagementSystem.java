TODO: Solid Assignment refactoring
TODO: S - Single Responsibility Principle
        - Each class should have only one reason to change or one responsibility.
TODO: O - Open/Closed Principle
        - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
TODO: L - Liskov Substitution Principle
        - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the functionality of the program.
TODO: I - Interface Segregation Principle
        - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
TODO: D - Dependency Inversion Principle
        - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
        - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.


TODO: Refactor to requirements (mostly done)
TODO: Design documentation, class diagrams, interaction diagrams, db schema
TODO: Unit Tests... Did some manual testing and played around with the test generator
        Did not add our header template because we didn't actually write them
TODO: Exception handling:
        known issues:
        Search function will crash program if you enter field that does not exist?
        Or is because I used prepared statement wrong? does (set[type], var) only used to
        inject type values int sql query. I tried to use method to set tableName and column,
        but it broke the search function
        Need to reply when items are not found or does not exist. user book loan table...
TODO: Interfaces can be simplified or abstracted for common methods/behavior in different classes
        dbmanager, book, member, bookmanager, usermanager, etc...
TODO: Negative testing
TODO: Try to get close to 100 code coverage or at least cover important functions and interclass object
    interactions
TODO: Comment Code
TODO: Clean Up Code
TODO: Learn about Lambda functions
TODO: Find ways to reduce coupling
